## Lessons Learned
* Unless the forward engineering process in the MySql workbench is completed succeessful, the intended page will not display on the browser.
* Creating each transaction in its own JSP (JavaServer Page) file makes for good organized work than to lump all transactions in one JSP file.
* Thorough reading of the codes and well-organized queries are essential to deliver the exact intended pages on the browser.
